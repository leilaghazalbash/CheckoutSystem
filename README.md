# CheckoutSystem
This project implements a checkout system for a supermarket where items are identified using Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). Each item has a unit price, and some items have special pricing rules (e.g., buy three for a discounted price). The checkout system is designed to accept items in any order and apply the correct pricing rules.

## Features

- Apply special pricing rules for items with discounts.
- Easily configurable pricing rules for different items.
- Developed using C# and .NET Core.

## Technologies Used
